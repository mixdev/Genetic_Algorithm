#Genetic Algorithm example

This program does nothing useful other than making you understand how it can be used to solve a realworld problem.

A simple program to generate the string "Hello World!". Code runs smooth on PHP 5.3. It will start with a string and introduce a random mutation in the charecters of the string. If the mutation is favorable to quickly arrive at the target string, it will be allowed to create the next generation of string. It will take weeks for a bruteforce program to coin "Hello World" while the genetic algorithm does it in minutes.
